# A Brain F*** interpreter ðŸ§  written in c++

## What is Brani F*** ?


<br>

    Brain F*** is  a esoteric programming language 
    which just means its not well known as other languages


> for further details about the language have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">This Wikipedia Page</a>

<br>
<br>

# Why do i care about this language?


<br>

    This language is really challenging and exciting to code in.
    You would get a great excitement while developing some new techinques 
    and its good to test and practice your algorithm and problem solving skills.

> although brain f*** is not used in real world programming . imo its good for even beginners to start thinking logically. and it helps to learn a lots of tactics for intermediates.
